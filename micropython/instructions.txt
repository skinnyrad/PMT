Instructions for developing micropython for PMT:

READ:
All of our custom code is split up into seperate modules. Each module is imported with:
	import <modulename>
Each of our modules is its own directory located in:
	~/Documents/micropython/pmtmodules
Please, ONLY EDIT THESE MODULES. Please do not mess with the code inside the official repo unless you really know what you're doing:
	~/Documents/micropython/micropython

1) after editing one of our custom modules:
	cd ~/Documents/micropython/micropython/ports/esp32

2) compile with:
	make USER_C_MODULES=~/Documents/micropython/pmtmodules/ CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DMODULE_EXAMPLE_ENABLED=1 PYTHON=python2 all

3) load to board with:
	make erase (optional but recommended)
	make deploy

4) access your modded micropython terminal:
	picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

5) IDK how you properly exit the terminal :)


NOTE: If during compilation the esp-idf throws a warning that the version is incorrect
	and recommend v3.3 or 4 something (experimental) thats because the .git which identifies 	git version has been renamed to ..git so git commits would ignore it as a repo
	and treat it as a directory to not be updated.
